/**
 * This code generates a simple VGA signal that shows red, green, and blue bars across the screen.
 * 
 * A VGA signal is relatively simple. I'm only using 6 pins: ground, vsync, hsync, red, green, blue.
 * VGA draws the picture from top to bottom, left to right. I'm using a standard 640x480 resolution.
 * The monitor draws 480 vertical lines, each of which take about 32us.
 * The signal also contains 32 additional blank lines called the vertical blanking interval at the beginning.
 * 
 * The vsync pin is used to send a pulse every time a new frame should start.
 * The standard is 60hz, so it is set to pulse for 64us every 1/60th of a second.
 * This along with the vertical blanking interval helps the monitor know where the picture should start.
 * 
 * The hsync pin is used to send a pulse every time a new line should start.
 * Since we have 480 lines for 480 vertical pixels, we pulse once every line (32us).
 * 
 * The red, green, and blue pins are used to control the color the monitor draws.
 * Their voltage corresponds to the color intensity of whatever pixel we happen to be drawing.
 * As the monitor scans from left to right during a line, it reads the analog RGB values and draws them on the screen.
 * 
 * I used this wikipedia page to gather all of this info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array

   * Setup timer for fast PWM for pulsing vsync.
   * This needs to be used because the built-in PWM functions are not precise enough.
   * This is pin 11 on the Arduino Mega 2560.
   * The way this works is that there's a counter which starts at 0 and ends at a predetermined value.

   * We apply a prescaler of 1024 here, which means that the timer will count up every 64us.
   * Once it reaches the value we want, the pin is switched on. It stays on for another arbitrary amount of counts.
   * The timer also calls an interrupt (defined above) everytime it fires.
